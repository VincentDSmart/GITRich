Yeah, you don't know how save your files,
Mr. Drive saying that you have too many files.
Suddenly you find Git V-S-C,
and your problems are gone,
A-S-A-P.

Lit, Lit,
leave your problems to git.
Just upload your file,
to your git.

Soon you realize what power it has,
even more than your chicks thick hot ass.
Yeah its the Version Control, 
and you need to get your files under control.

Lit, Lit,
leave your problems to git.
Just upload your file,
to your git.

Here you got,
this is it.
Now go and play with your git.

Lit, Lit,
leave your problems to git.
Just upload your file,
to your git. (X2)
